<p>After nine months on Octopress, I've decided to move on.</p>
<p>I should start by saying that Octopress is a great platform for static
blogging: it's powerful, flexible, well-supported, well-integrated with
GitHub pages, and has tools and plugins to do just about anything you might
imagine.  There's only one problem:</p>
<p>It's written in Ruby.</p>
<p>Now I don't have anything against Ruby per se.  However, it was starting to
seem a bit awkward that a blog called <em>Pythonic Perambulations</em>
was built with Ruby, especially given the availability of so many
excellent Python-based static site generators
(<a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a>,
<a href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/">Nikola</a>,
and <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> in particular).</p>
<p>Additionally, a few things with Octopress were starting to become difficult:
